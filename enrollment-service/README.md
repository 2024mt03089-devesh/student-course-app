# ðŸŽ¯ Enrollment Service â€” Go + MySQL
 
---

The **Enrollment Service** acts as the **core integration point** within the *Student-Course-App* ecosystem.
Developed in **Go** using the **Gin web framework** and backed by **MySQL**, this service manages the relationship between students and courses â€” ensuring that only valid student and course records are linked.


It embodies **microservice autonomy**, **high performance**, and **reliable data validation** by communicating directly with the `student-service` and `course-service` APIs.
