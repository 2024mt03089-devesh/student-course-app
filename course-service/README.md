# ðŸŽ“ Course Service â€” Python + Flask + PostgreSQL Microservice
 
---
 
The **Course Service** is a lightweight, containerized **Python (Flask)** microservice that manages course-related data. It provides APIs to **create** and **retrieve** course information stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.


This service is part of a distributed microservices ecosystem (alongside the **Student Service**) and is designed with modularity, portability, and scalability in mind.
